                We not only want to help our clients improve at the game of basketball, but we strive to develop personal relationships and provide mentorship. They are much more than just clients and we care about them far beyond the game of basketball.
              </p><br/>
              <p>
                We love the game of basketball, but we love Jesus more! Basketball can be a great ministry opportunity, which is why our goal is to use basketball as a platform to build relationships and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our number one priority is to teach our clients about who Jesus is, how much He loves them, and what it means to follow Him.
