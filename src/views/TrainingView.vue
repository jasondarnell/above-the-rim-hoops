            Personalized Game-Film Analysis
          </v-card-title>
          <v-card-text class="px-16">
            Unfortunately, high school and AAU coaches do not have the time to breakdown each individual player’s in-game performance. Hudl and other services are great, but they do not offer any real coaching advice. At ATR Hoops, we offer a personalized breakdown of game film complete with in-game recommendations, strategical tips, and drill work for future success. Game footage can be easily shared through Hudl, Google, or a number of other ways. Personalized game-film analysis is one of the foremost ways for players to improve their game in-season. 
            <br /><br />
            (Please note, game-film analysis will not be done for 1A Illinois boy’s basketball players due to potential conflict of interest. All other boys and girls players from any locations, including any other Illinois boys’ classes, are gladly accepted.)
