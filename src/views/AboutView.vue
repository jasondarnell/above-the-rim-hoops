        Above the Rim hoops was founded in 2023 by Alex Altmix for two purposes. 

        First, ATR was founded to fill a void in a small-town local basketball scene. Whether it was during the 1980’s or just last year, Quincy, IL and its surrounding area was and is a basketball hotbed. The Illinois side of the Mississippi river deserved its own basketball training company that could fit its needs. 

        Second, and more importantly, ATR was created to help young athletes thrive where it truly matters in life: hence, the name, “Above the Rim.” While the game of basketball is meaningful, the cross represented by the “t” in the Above the Rim logo is much more important. Too often, talented young athletes are left without a mentor or leader to properly guide them through basketball, let alone life. Above the Rim Hoops was founded to do just that: mentor young athletes and help them successfully navigate their way through basketball, life, and faith.

          Alex Altmix
        </h2>
       Alex grew up in a basketball family. His father, Greg, has been a head varsity coach for over 14 seasons. Alex has been around and personally involved in some of the best coaches, practices, and games the tri-state area has had to offer over the last 20-plus years.

        Alex has coached in the Liberty High School basketball program since 2015 and has been the JV coach since 2019. During that time, the Eagles have won multiple regional championships, multiple sectional championships, and made two trips to the state tournament. In 2022, Liberty finished in second place overall, resulting in the best finish and record in school history. Furthermore, the Eagles have accrued many individual awards during this time including a player of the year award, all-state selections, and multiple coach of the year awards. 

        On a personal level, Alex was a teacher for the last six years before founding ATR. He has experience working with youth from elementary age through high school.
